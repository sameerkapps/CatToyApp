This was a fun project done in Microsoft hackathon to connect to WioTerminal from a cross platform app using Azure IoTHub.
The project had two objective:
- Be able to start and stop game from the App
- View the temperature and humidity near the terminal

Out of the two, ability to start and stop the game has been done.
WioTerminal emits the temperature and humidity as telemetry. It can be seen in the Azure IoT explorer.  I did not get enough time to incorporate it in the App.

Several more improvements can be done to it. I will do them as the time permits.

This is just the beginning.

The corresponding firmware for the WioTerminal can be found in https://github.com/sameerkapps/CatToyFirmware
